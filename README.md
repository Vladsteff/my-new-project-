# What we think we become

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

AI is a human creation ,AI represents us.AI is what we would to be.A brain that knows everything.


## Background

Throughout our lives we humans encounter problems,some smaller,some larger,we are always looking for solution,some better ,some less. AI cold solve these problems much more efficiently and find solutions much faster and correctly.The only thing we need to know is that we creat AI and not the other way around. It is important not to lose control of reality.

* disorientation
* etc.


## How is it used?

AI is our future and we will all take part in creating. Let's make this future "brain" clean and beatiful.

This is how you create code examples:
```
def main():
   countries = ['Denmark', 'Finland', 'Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden']
   pop = [5615000, 5439000, 324000, 5080000, 9609000]   # not actually needed in this exercise...
   fishers = [1891, 2652, 3800, 11611, 1757]

   totPop = sum(pop)
   totFish = sum(fishers)

   # write your solution here

   for i in range(len(countries)):
      print("%s %.2f%%" % (countries[i], 100.0))    # current just prints 100%

main()
```

## Challenges

We cannot impose,we can only help.

## What next?

Sooner or later AI will touch us all. We have to be prepared to accept it into our lives. There are many of us, we can team up to help the sensitive future. To be fair and balanced.
